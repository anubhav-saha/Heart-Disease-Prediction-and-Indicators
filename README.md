# Heart-Disease-Prediction-and-Indicators
In this project weâ€™ve chosen the dataset of heart disease that includes 14 variables into play. We will use the methods of Hypothesis Testing to test an hypothesis related to the heart disease like whether higher age contributes in a higher probability of heart disease or not.  We will also be using the methods of logistic regression and classification using decision trees to build a model using our training dataset and predict on the test dataset and observe the accuracy rate of our built model. Decision tree classification method has been selected to build the model as it provides accurate results along with a well detailed plot to visualize the results. Logistic Regression has been chosen as it is very efficient in predicting a binary outcome variable. It also reduces overfitting of the model by eliminating variables that are not significantly impacting in the prediction outcome.
